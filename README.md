# AGamutMaskToolFork

An offline version of The Gamut Mask Tool made by Richard Robinson, with a couple of tweaks I added myself. The original gamut mask concept is by James Gurney. I'm also hosting it over on [my own github page](https://wreckstation.github.io/AGamutMaskToolFork/). You can still visit and use the [original free online version here](https://mypaintingclub.com/blog/post/39-The-Gamut-Mask-Tool) if you don't like this one.

# Stuff I changed:
* Third wheel that is the YURMBY wheel but with the colors blended together, if you decided that the pallet was too limiting.
* Third slider that controls the size of the gamut mask.
* Button next to the print button that resets sliders and color wheel rotation to their default.
* Updated link to homepage.
* Removed telemetry related scripts like google tag manager, pintrest/fb widgets

Stuff I might do later:
* night mode
* blended version of standard color wheel
* less obviously placeholder ui
* more flexible layout

# How to use
Should be self explanatory, but other things less documented:
* You can click and drag the rim of the wheel to rotate it
* You can click and drag the mask shapes to move them around too
* You can right click -> copy the wheel to paste into any art program you want

The actual colors are your limited color pallet. Select a handful of colors, at the very least the ones at the corners of the mask, those will be your most saturated colors. All you can paint with are now these colors and a combination thereof. Altering the value (HSV) or luminosity (HLS) of each color is highly recommended.
